# Weather py

## User Stories
- As a user i want to be able to view the current days weather
- As a user i want to be able to choose where i am viewing
- As a user i want to be able to see the forecast for the next 5 days
- As a user i want to see more detailed data about the current days weather
- As a user i want to be able to compare the weather between two places of my choosing

## UX
As this is a console line app I am limited to how I can customize the ui, so I have gone with having a bordered header with some ascii art of the projects title, and I generated the ascii art using this [website](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big&t=Weather%20py), and then below that will be a line dedicated to system messages for the user, menu of options for the user to choose from, and then below that will be the loaded data if the user has gone through one of the options atleast once.
